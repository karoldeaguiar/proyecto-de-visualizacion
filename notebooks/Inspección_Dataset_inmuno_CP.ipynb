FDA-approved neoadjuvant-immunotherapy-based approaches include triple-negative breast cancer and early non-small cell lung cancer on the basis of improvement in pathological response and event free survival. Nevertheless, current trials have only shown benefits in a fraction of patients. It is therefore crucial to identify predictive biomarkers to improve patient selection for such approaches. This review aims to provide an overview of potential biomarkers of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in early triple-negative breast cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer and gastric cancer. By the extrapolation of the metastatic setting, we explore known predictive biomarkers, i.e., PD-L1, mismatch repair deficiency and tumour mutational burden, as well as potential early-disease-specific biomarkers. We also discuss the challenges of identifying reliable biomarkers and the need for standardized protocols and guidelines for their validation and clinical implementation.\",\n          \"PURPOSE: Our understanding of the immunopathology of resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still limited. Here, we explore immune programs that inform of tumor immunity and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy in localized NSCLC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Targeted immune gene sequencing using the HTG Precision Immuno-Oncology panel was performed in localized NSCLCs from three cohorts based on treatment: naive (n = 190), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 38), and neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (n = 21). Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) phenotypes were based on the location of CD8+ T cells (inflamed, cold, excluded), tumoral PD-L1 expression (<1% and >/=1%), and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Immune programs and signatures were statistically analyzed on the basis of tumoral PD-L1 expression, immune phenotypes, and pathologic response and were cross-compared across the three cohorts. RESULTS: PD-L1-positive tumors exhibited increased signature scores for various lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets (P < 0.05). TIME phenotypes exhibited disparate frequencies by stage, PD-L1 expression, and mutational burden. Inflamed and PD-L1+/TILs+ NSCLCs displayed overall significantly heightened levels of immune signatures, with the excluded group representing an intermediate state. A cytotoxic T-cell signature was associated with favorable survival in neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated NSCLCs (P < 0.05). Pathologic response to chemoimmunotherapy was positively associated with higher expression of genes involved in immune activation, chemotaxis, as well as T and natural killer cells (P < 0.05 for all). Among the three cohorts, chemoimmunotherapy-treated NSCLCs exhibited the highest scores for various immune cell subsets including T effector and B cells (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight immune gene programs that may underlie host tumor immunity and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy in resectable NSCLC.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2.540473524996043,\n        \"min\": 2004.0,\n        \"max\": 2026.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2025.0,\n          2007.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"countries\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 271,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"China. 15562481150@163.Com\",\n          \"Usa.

BACKGROUND: Concurrent chemoradiation plus consolidation immunotherapy is the standard of care for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however, whether induction chemoimmunotherapy plus surgery can provide good efficiency and safety for this population is unclear. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of induction chemoimmunotherapy plus surgery in unresectable stage III NSCLC. METHODS: Patients with stage I-III NSCLC receiving neoadjuvant/induction chemoimmunotherapy were screened. Kaplan-Meier method, propensity score matching (PSM), Cox regression, and subgroup and sensitivity analysis were used for comparation in disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Perioperative safety was also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 425 NSCLC patients underwent neoadjuvant/induction chemoimmunotherapy plus surgery consisting of 278 with unresectable stage III and 147 with resectable IB-IIIA disease were enrolled. DFS was comparable between unresectable and resectable cohort before [hazard ratio (HR): 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65-1.38, P=0.77] and after (HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.66-1.76, P=0.75) PSM. In addition, OS before (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.57-2.02, P=0.83) and after (HR: 1.40, 95% CI: 0.63-3.09, P=0.41) PSM had no significant difference between the two cohorts. The 3-year DFS (68.7% vs. 66.2%) and OS (87.8% vs. 89.3%) were similar in the two cohorts respectively. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis exhibited consistent results. R0 resection rate, blood loss in surgery, length of hospital stay after surgery, 30-day mortality, and 90-mortality also showed no significant difference between the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Induction chemoimmunotherapy plus surgery can bring satisfying DFS/OS with good safety for unresectable stage III NSCLC.

Therapeutic hurdles persist in the fight against lung cancer, although it is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Results are still not up to par, even with the best efforts of conventional medicine, thus new avenues of investigation are required. Examining how immunotherapy, precision medicine, and AI are being used to manage lung cancer, this review shows how these tools can change the game for patients and increase their chances of survival. In the fight against cancer, immunotherapy has demonstrated encouraging results, especially in cases of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A key component in improving T cell responses against tumours is the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, which include PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockers. Cancer vaccines and CAR T-cell therapy are two examples of adoptive cell therapies that might be used to boost the immune system's ability to eliminate tumours. In order to improve surgical results and decrease recurrence, neoadjuvant immunotherapy is being investigated for its ability to preoperatively reduce tumours. Precision medicine tailors treatment based on individual genetic profiles and tumour features, boosting therapeutic efficacy and avoiding unwanted effects. For certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), targeted treatments based on mutations in genes including EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 have shown excellent results. When it comes to optimizing treatment regimens, biomarker-driven approaches guarantee that the patients most likely to benefit from particular medicines are selected. Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing lung cancer care through increased diagnostic accuracy, prognostic assessments, and therapy planning. Machine learning algorithms examine enormous information to detect trends and forecast outcomes, permitting individualized treatment techniques. AI-driven imaging tools enable early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression, while predictive models assist in evaluating therapy responses and potential toxicity. The convergence of these advanced technologies holds promise for overcoming the constraints of conventional therapy. Combining immunotherapy with targeted treatments and utilizing AI for precision medicine delivers a multimodal approach that tackles the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of lung cancer. The incorporation of these new tactics into clinical practice demands cross-disciplinary collaboration and continuing study to develop and confirm their effectiveness. The synergistic application of immunotherapy, precision medicine, and AI constitutes a paradigm shift in lung cancer management. These discoveries provide a robust basis for individualized and adaptable therapy, potentially altering the prognosis for lung cancer patients. Ongoing research and clinical studies are vital to unlocking the full potential of these technologies, paving the way for enhanced therapeutic outcomes and improved quality of life for people battling this tough disease.

    "Este índice es un **indicador derivado**, inspirado en técnicas clásicas de ponderación de términos como **TF-IDF**, y adaptado mediante **criterio experto** para su aplicación en un dominio clínico específico. Su objetivo es puramente exploratorio y está orientado a apoyar el análisis visual y la identificación de literatura central dentro del conjunto analizado.\n",
